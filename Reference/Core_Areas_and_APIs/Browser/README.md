## Sailfish OS Browser

The web browser in Sailfish OS is a fully open-source component which has been developed in active collaboration with community members. It uses Sailfish Silica UI elements for the browser chrome, and an embedded Gecko engine for content rendering. The source code can be found at <https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser> and is available under a permissive MPLv2.0 license.

## Debugging

Logging instruction can be found on the [browser development page](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Browser/Working_with_Browser/#enabling-module-log-output).
