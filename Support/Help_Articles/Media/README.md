This article is about the Media application that can be download from the Jolla Store.
It is possible to add music to your Sailfish device, either to the Mass storage or to a micro SD memory card in the device. More information about the SD card can be found [here](/Support/Help_Articles/SD_Card_Format_and_Encryption/).

# Media application

Media application main view has following content

<div class="flex-images" markdown="1">

* <a href="Media_main_view.png" class="narrow-image"><img src="Media_main_view.png" alt="Media main view"></a>
  <span class="md_figcaption">
  </span>
</div>

In that view you can see all playlists, songs, albums and artist on your Sailfish device. You can create new Playlists by tapping "Playlists" and from then Playlist view you can add playlist from the pulley menu, you can also use search.

From the All songs view songs can be added to playlists, added to play queue or can be deleted (note that the delete actually removes the song from the device). From the pulley menu songs can be also shuffled and searched, search is also available under Albums and Artists. Please note that songs in the queue will be removed when the Media application is closed.

## Instructions for Windows and Linux PCs to transfer music to your Sailfish device.
1. Connect your Sailfish device to your computer using a USB cable
2. Choose 'Media transfer (MTP)' in the dialog that appears on the screen of the Sailfish device.
3. Your Sailfish device appears on the PC, there are 'Card' and 'Mass storage'.
4. Copy your mp3 files from the PC to folders in the device memory or in the memory card.
5. Prefered location for the music files is the default folder 'Music'.
6. Once you have copied the music files check with PC that the files appear on their target folders on the Sailfish device.
7. Disconnect the USB cable from the device as soon as you are sure that the files have been copied.
8. Wait a couple of minutes so that the indexing of the files gets done.
9. You now have the music files in the device, and they appear in the Media application.

You can read more about [moving files between a PC and a Sailfish Device](/Support/Help_Articles/Moving_Files_Between_PC_and_Sailfish_Device/) and [moving files between a Mac and a Sailfish Device](/Support/Help_Articles/Moving_Files_between_Mac_and_Sailfish_Device/)

## Backups and music files

Sailfish OS does not currently include any music files to the Backup. Therefore we recommend keeping the music in the SD card - Media app can find and play the music in the card equally well. If you have music in the device memory it is best to make sure that your only copy of the music is not in Sailfish device memory. However playlists are included in the backups.
