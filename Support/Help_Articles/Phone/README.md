# Calling and receiving calls
In Sailfish the gesture indications to answer and reject calls are right under your thumb. Answer by swiping horizontally in either direction without having to worry about whether you picked up the device in the right orientation. Silence by swiping up or by pressing the power key. Calling can be done from the phone apps dialer, history or people pages or from the events view. Quick calling from the history can be enabled or disabled, more of this feature can be read from this [article](/Support/Help_Articles/Tips_and_Tricks/#quick-calls-from-the-call-history). From the same article you can also see how call recording can be enabled and once that is done you will have call record button on your call UI when the call is ongoing. With the call record button you can start and stop the call recording. Voice mail number can be also set on the same page.
