# Pre-requisites
To use your own audio file as a tone in your Sailfish device, your file must be playable with Media app. In other words, it must be compatible with the [audio codecs](https://docs.sailfishos.org/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Multimedia/#audio) supported by SailfishOS. We also recommend your files to contain information of the album and artist names.

You can also modify your audio files on your PC before transferring those to your Sailfish device. The tones can be placed in the phone memory or in the SD card.

You can read more about transferring files between your Sailfish device and your PC, please see [here](/Support/Help_Articles/Moving_Files_Between_PC_and_Sailfish_Device/).
